All answers are contained in the one file. The file contains all code nessessary to create all needed tables and the answer (code) for each question. There are 'COPY' statements to load the data but of course it is setup for my computer and you will need to change the path to your files if you want to run that code too.
For question 2, I wasn't quite sure what was meant by 'join the booking data and the room data'. In the context of a database and SQL, I took this to mean a VIEW. I used a LEFT JOIN of the bookings table to the rooms table in case there was ever an instance where there was a booking without a room. The booking would still show in the output.
The view created in question 3 was needed by question 2 so the answers were reversed.
For question 5, I wasn't sure of the grouping order so I provided SQL for both ways - room types within years and years within room types.
I used SQL in question 5 so there is nothing to do for question 6.
Once the tables are created and the data is loaded the the remaining SQL can be run one statement at a time.
Thanks Adam
